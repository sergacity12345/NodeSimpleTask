# NodeSimpleTask
We added an admin section where admin can signup
so many function can be done by the admine , like creating room types, editing room types, removing room types, getting a single room. An admin that is signed up can get all the room he/she created 
We also added User . Whereby a user can perfom certain functions like singup, creat room, edit room, get a single room , delete a single room. 
But before a user can be able to create a room , the admin must have created that room in which the user will now add to his own. Like going to hotel, the admin will have types of room like VIP,STANDARD etc, so if the admin created a VIP room, that is when the user can now use the room by creating his/her own room and passing in ID of that room type
